# Hi there!

Hey, if you are reading this, chances are you are interested in contributing to DeerX and have minimal background in Computer Science. Don't worry, this documentation aims to provide you with certain programming languages and technology that we use to develop the application. We hope that you have fun with the learning and development process. In addition to being Denison's very own secondary marketplace, DeerX is also a coding club for people looking to learn more about web/app developement.

# Programming Language and Technology Hierachy

A basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and Javascript is required to understand further technology and how it fits in. In addition, a basic knowledge of Git is required to setup the development environment. It is recommended that you know some basic usage of the Terminal (which usually is running Bash). DeerX is developed mainly using Typescript, which is a superset of the Javascript programing language infused with static type check. You will get to learn more about those language using the following introduction videos. Watch the introduction videos in the order below, feel free to google any terminology in those video that you don't fully understand (feel free to ask me).

  - [100+ JavaScript Concepts you Need to Know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkIFF4maKMU)
- This part is optional, they are core concepts of Javascript but won't be necessary until you have begin writing code, feel free to google, or write some example code, or ask me:

# Tips

I highly recommend using VS Code as your IDE (Integrated Development Environment). Don't worry if you don't know what it means, the following video explains it quite nicely: [VS Code in 100 Seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMxo3T_MTvY). You can install the IDE using this [link](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). Feel free to google any terminology you don't understand or ask me.

# Programming Language and Technology Hierachy

A basic understanding of Javascript is required to understand further technology and how it fits in. In addition, a basic knowledge of Git and Terminal (which usually is running Bash) is required to setup the development environment. DeerX Backend team is mostly working with Typescript, which is a superset of the Javascript programing language infused with static type check. We are using Firebase as our core services. You will get to learn more about those programming languages and technologies using the following introduction videos. Watch the introduction videos in the order below, feel free to google any terminology in those video that you don't fully understand (feel free to ask me).

# Tips

I highly recommend using VS Code as your IDE (Integrated Development Environment). Don't worry if you don't know what it means, the following video explains it quite nicely: [VS Code in 100 Seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMxo3T_MTvY). You can install the IDE using this [link](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). Feel free to google any terminology you don't understand or ask me.
